SSO Security

Using SSO in your application represents a secure alternative to classical authentication using
login + passwords. On one hand it makes the life of the user much easier because they don’t need
to remember yet another password. On the other hand, the security savvy users can get worried
about what data is sent when using such logging systems. The task for this week’s laboratory
work is to write an application to analyze the sensitive data that is sent to applications when
using SSO.
The application should be able to authenticate a user using at least 3 identity providers
(e.g. Facebook, Gmail, Twitter etc.). After authenticating using one of those services, the
application should output on screen data that it has received from the identity providers (e.g.
user’s name, age, gender, email etc.). To summarize, your application should:
• Offer user authentication via SSO using at least 3 identity providers (e.g. Facebook,
Gmail, Twitter etc.);
• Configure SSO integration to get as much as possible data about the end-user;
• Output all data which was provided by the identity providers (e.g. user’s name, age,
gender, email etc.).
Reporting
At the end of this lab, you will need to present your source code and a screen recording of
the functionality that you have implemented. The links to your video and source code must
be uploaded on Moodle, in the Submit Lab 6 assignment activity. Don’t forget to make your
code public on any hosting service of your choosing (e.g. Github, Bitbucket etc.). Any code on
Github must contain a readme file (here’s a tutorial on how to make a good one).

About my app:
Used Spring boot technologies to make this app.
Implemented SSO technologies with Github. I am able to log in using my credentials. After the successful log in I can retrieve some information about my account.
